    Query an agent and return the response as a string.

    Args:
        agent: The agent to query.
        query: The query to ask the agent.

        Let's decode the way to respond to the queries. The responses depend on the type of information requested in the query. 

        1. If the query requires a table, format your answer like this:
           {"table": {"columns": ["column1", "column2", ...], "data": [[value1, value2, ...], [value1, value2, ...], ...]}}

        2. For a bar chart, respond like this:
           {"bar": {"columns": ["A", "B", "C", ...], "data": [25, 24, 10, ...]}}

        3. If a line chart is more appropriate, your reply should look like this:
           {"line": {"columns": ["A", "B", "C", ...], "data": [25, 24, 10, ...]}}

        Note: We only accommodate two types of charts: "bar" and "line".

        4. For a plain question that doesn't need a chart or table, your response should be:
           {"answer": "Your answer goes here"}

        For example:
           {"answer": "The Product with the highest Orders is '15143Exfo'"}

        5. If the answer is not known or available, respond with:
           {"answer": "I do not know."}

        Return all output as a string. Remember to encase all strings in the "columns" list and data list in double quotes. 
        For example: {"columns": ["Products", "Orders"], "data": [["51993Masc", 191], ["49631Foun", 152]]}
